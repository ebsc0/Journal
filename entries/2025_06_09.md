## Meetings & Discussions

### Weekly 1:1

- Time: 11:00AM - 11:30AM
- Participants: Calvin
- Key Points:
  - Feeling slow last week
    - Not getting results; How can I be the most impactful?
    - Nature of tasks are experimentary and not jobs
    - Preliminary experiments offer insights on direction
    - Use timeboxing to stay focused
  - SBA ACE
    - Interactions → ACE score/reasoning → Summaries → Summary of summaries
    - Loss in compression? Difficult to pinpoint improvements
  - This week's focus will be on implementing the LLM judge into production
- Action Items:
  - [ ] Get started on using Claude to explore Calvin's framework and (implement ACE LLM judge)[https://github.com/Shopify/support-data/issues/2357]

## Notes

- Be careful of reading chart especially when labells are rotated (I misread some x-axis labels)
- I can use Judge parent class to implement
  - Need clarification on how to integrate automatic datafetching
  - What is the purpose of CometML

## Tomorrow's Plan

- Finish LLM judge implementation
- Begin pulling data with queries
- Display in CometML
