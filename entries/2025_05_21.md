# Wednesday - May 21st

## Daily Overview

- Start Time: 9:17AM
- End Time: 8:33PM

## Today's Priorities

1. Start on Shop bot judge
2. Pairing session with Shannon

## Tasks & Progress

### Completed

- SBA inquiry classification prototype
  - Implement sql seperation of response

### In Progress

- SBA inquiry classification prototype
  - Implement sql seperation of response
  - Manually label classification
    - Labeled by hiding actual classification to remove bias
    - What do we consider a successful interaction?
      - Ex. Is the question "How do I see my orders" and "My orders are not showing up" are similar questions but at different stages
    - If someone just says "Delivery", is it a correct response to assume they want to see their order delivery status?
      - Are there default assumptions baked into the model? If so, are those classified as suficient or ambiguous?
  - Create report
    - Classifying each message is limiting the context of the classification bot which may direct the message to an unrelated bot
    - Ask Calvin on how this actually works
      - On a message level, some are ambiguous but on a session level, it is not ambiguous
    - On my 2nd labelling attempt, I will self-prompt
      - I will only consider the message, not the session
      - If the subject is relevant but the objective is not clear, it will be marked ambiguous
        - Only when I understand what the question is will I look at the supporting documents
        - Ex. order: Place an order? Check order? Refund an order?
      - Seemingly random text will be labelled as off_topic_general
- Read [Replacing Judges with Juries](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18796)
- Technical Onboarding
  - Current status: Ruby (OOP)
- PP session prep
  - Shannon - 05.21

## Meetings & Discussions

### Pair Programming

- Time: 11:00AM - 11:45AM
- Participants: Calvin
- Key Points:
  - SBA inquiry classification
  - 2 hour timeblock for manual label
    - Use SQL to seperate titles and description from response
    - Not necessary to read through chunk to determine sufficient/insufficient
      - Maybe use LLM to provide summary?
  - Prototype on 1 judge and then attempt jury
  - Final prototype is report document for Friday
- Action Items:
  - [x] Push PR for previous work
  - [x] Implement sql seperation of response
  - [ ] Create report

### LLM Evals Standup

- Time: 12:45PM - 1:00PM
- Participants: Calvin, Peter, Delali, Kasey
- Key Points:
  - GoldenV2 examples by the end of the week
  - No good way to judge is sufficient/insufficient without spending a lot of time
- Action Items:
  - [x] Look into ways to condense retrieved chunks so that an annotator can easily determine sufficiency
    - Results return a list of sources so seperating by title, description, chunk would not provide clarity
    - We should use title and description only instead

### Pair Programming

- Time: 1:00PM - 2:00PM
- Participants: Shannon
- Key Points:
  - Kafka events track raw events
    - Either specific to an application or general purpose using Dux
  - Monorail ingests these raw events and allows Data Engineers to transform them into datasets
  - Datasets come in multiple flavours
    - Base is the columns of the raw monorail event being selected
    - Intermediary is taking the base and cleaning
    - Mart is taking intermediary datasets and transforming into application specific datasets
  - de-PII effor has been undertaken before
    - Could not guarantee that PII is erased so any field with the possibility of PII is redacted
    - Niharika worked on it before she left
      - Could ask her for more details
