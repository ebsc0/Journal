# Thursday - May 22nd

## Daily Overview

- Start Time: 9:05AM
- End Time: 6:00PM

## Today's Priorities

1. Complete analytical step of Shop bot classification

## Tasks & Progress

### Completed

- SBA inquiry classification prototype
  - Implement sql seperation of response
  - Manually label classification

### In Progress

- SBA inquiry classification prototype
  - Create report
    - Classifying each message is limiting the context of the classification bot which may direct the message to an unrelated bot
    - Ask Calvin on how this actually works
      - On a message level, some are ambiguous but on a session level, it is not ambiguous
    - On my 2nd labelling attempt, I will self-prompt
      - I will only consider the message, not the session
      - If the subject is relevant but the objective is not clear, it will be marked ambiguous
        - Only when I understand what the question is will I look at the supporting documents
        - Ex. order: Place an order? Check order? Refund an order?
      - Seemingly random text will be labelled as off_topic_general
- Read [Replacing Judges with Juries](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18796)
- Technical Onboarding
  - Current status: Ruby (OOP)
- PP session prep
  - Shannon - 05.21

## Meetings & Discussions

### Daily Standup

- Time: 11:30AM - 11:50AM
- Participants: Calvin
- Key Points:
  - Ask Kasey on using similarity scores for sufficient or insufficient passages
  - Is this a usefull LLM judge to pursue?
    - Why?
    - Reconciling my own judgement with LLM judgement
      - Is it a disagreement that LLM is wrong or is there a fundamental difference in what a good classification is.
      - If the errors between humans
      - Take another 100 samples and label
        - See if self-disagreement goes down

### LLM Eval Standup

- Time: 1:30PM - 1:45PM
- Participants: Calvin, Peter, Kasey, Delali
- Key Points:
  - SBA does classification with response generation as opposed to an initial classification stage which occurs in HCA

### Pair Programming

- Time: 2:00PM - 2:30PM
- Participants: Peter
- Key Points:
  - Spoke about difficulties in evaluating LLMs
    - Realistic case is if LLMs can filter the hardest fail cases for manual review

## Tomorrow's Plan

- Fix "support request" class
- Finish report
