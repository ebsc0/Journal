# Wednesday - June 3rd

## Daily Overview

- Start Time: 9:45AM
- End Time: [Time you finished work]

## Today's Priorities

1. Statistical analysis of annotator-annotator and annotator-bot classifications
2. Use LLM judge to evaluate on annotator-annotator agreement dataset

## Tasks & Progress

## Meetings & Discussions

### Pair Programming

- Time: 11:00AM - 11:45AM
- Participants: Calvin
- ## Key Points:
  - Want to get a good sense if LLM judge can serve as a good benchmark for SBA classification
  - Pivot to ACE for overall response quality evaluation
    - Expectation is to see a distinct difference in quality where transitions in model occured
      - Ex. May 7th when Kasey made changes to HCA
- Action Items:
  - [x] Checkpoint SBA Classification Judge
    - [x] Get classification and Kappa stats on LLM Judge vs. High-Agreement samples
    - [x] Post to project channel
  - [ ] Spin up a PR for SBA Classification Judge
    - [x] Commit your code so you don't lose it, push to GitHub, send me the branch
    - [ ] Create new branch
    - [ ] Ask Cursor or Claude Code to refactor notebooks into Python modules, make sure the code runs (time box to 1hr)
  - [ ] Evaluate ACE
    - [ ] Post to project channel

### LLM Evals Standup

- Time: 2:00PM - 2:20PM
- Participants: Calvin, Peter, Delali
- Key Points:
  - Peter generated synthetic data to increase fail cases
    - Generated data using LLM generation
    - Generate partially and fully incorrect samples
