# Thursday - May 15th

## Daily Overview
- Start Time: 8:54AM
- End Time: 5:04PM

## Today's Priorities
1. Finish labeling and prompting LLM eval
2. Perform statistical analysis of LLM eval performance
3. Finish onboarding

## Tasks & Progress
### Completed
- Label SBA interactions [samples](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C_e-9mWuntHttaK562nS7sP_d1yXdOTbhRj84eCIEjQ/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
  - Alot of the problems is passed onto the merchant (ex. order related info)
    - Is there a classification for merchant handoffs?
  - The same problems keep being asked
    - Would it be beneficial to have specialized agents to handle them?
- Experiment with LLMs for response evaluations with few-shot prompting
  - LLM is good at giving a convincing reason but is that a good evaluation is not always true
- Statistical analysis of LLM Eval
  - Set up UV on support-data-ml
  - Run LLM Eval agent on all interactions
- Used UV to create a project in support-data-ml

### In Progress
- Statistical analysis of LLM Eval
  - Write a 1-page findings doc
  - Compute accuracy with human label as ground truth
  - Include metric and provide any insights gained in findings doc
- Technical Onboarding
  - Current status: Ruby (OOP)
- PP session prep

    - There is nice HCA figma [here](https://www.figma.com/board/adP5RsboOcRIitTh1mYqdL/Help-Center-Assistant-State-Diagram?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=i81qOBKNqrQMmxNk-0) and there are these three videos of code walkthrough for QAU (behind HCA) and copilot - that @alex.salle did.
    - Here are three videos (in order). One of them doesn’t have sound though except for me talking - technical error! But it might still be slightly helpful as you can see what code Alex is going through

    - These just give some familiarity with the code but if you don’t have time to go over them no worries!

## Meetings & Discussions
### Daily Standup
- Time: 10:02AM - 10:20AM
- Participants: Calvin
- Key Points:
  - Keep track of insights
  - Clarifying intent is beneficial and can lead to more interactions to train on
  - I am curious if it is better to specialize agents in specific problems and have a classification agent to funnel the problems
    - This intuition is from observing alot of the same problems from users
- Action Items:
  - [ ] Write a 1-page findings doc
  - [x] Set up UV on support-ml-science
  - [x] Run LLM Eval agent on all interactions
  - [ ] Compute accuracy with human label as ground truth
  - [ ] Include metric and provide any insights gained in findings doc

## Technical Notes
- [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv)
  - `uv init`: initialize project
  - `uv add`: add dependency
  - `uv remove`: remove dependency
  - `uv run`: run app
  - `uv sync`: update dependency

## Learnings & Insights
- Experiment to see if clarification or rewrite agent is able to correctly understand the users intent. We test a population on chatbot that summarizes the users problem and asks if it is correct.
  - Ex.
  - User: Change address of account.
  - Bot: Are you looking to change the email address on your account?
  - User: Yes.
- AI search and HCA take from knowledge base to form a response to resolve a user's problem. Is the knowledge base only text? Why not make responses multi-modal? Also, should users be able to input images of their problem?
- Hack day idea - gamify shopify: Open world where players can create a sprite and explore. Players can go to shops, buy things, etc...
- Is support a product or a tool? Can and should we offer support to merchants so that we handle the customer service aspect?
  - Best positioned to handle customer support with:
    - Knowledge of customer: are they a scammer or a real customer? Do they have a lot of other refunds across more merchants?
    - Inventory: How much can the user buy?
    - Tracking/shipping: Did the order ship?
    - Sales: are there any promo codes?
- Shopify has its own [LLM APIs](https://openai-proxy.shopify.io/) and [proxy](https://github.com/shopify/openai-proxy-access)

## Challenges & Solutions
- OpenAI has builtin features for [controlling output format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs)

## Tomorrow's Plan
- Prepare for pairing session with Kate
- Continue with statistical analysis
- Clear backlog
