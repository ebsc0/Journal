# Thursday - June 4th

## Daily Overview

- Start Time: 9:10AM
- End Time: 5:19PM

## Today's Priorities

1. Start on ACE evals
2. Wrap up Classification

## Tasks & Progress

### Completed

- ACE
  - Created script for parallel requests to OpenAI
  - Evaluated 50 samples per day from May 6th to Today
  - Saw the same jump in ACE score as seen by Delali

### In Progress

- ACE
  - Pull more samples per day
    - Then 50 -> 100 samples from [~2.5k samples](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dvf0ZMQgb9DH0-pSNXZ1Uc9m0x6yBpJIW-Wy7C1E3gI/edit?usp=sharing)
    - Filter on candidate_sessions where message != REDACTED and locale == en
    - Time is last 30 days
- Classification Set Analysis
  - Create 1-page writeup
- Fill out internship log
  - Write update on Summit and progress
  - Include anything pushed
- Technical Onboarding
  - Current status: Ruby (OOP)
- Think about contract extension; Make sure sequence is correct

## Meetings & Discussions

### Daily Standup

- Time: 10:00AM - 10:20AM
- Participants: Calvin
- Key Points:
  - We want to get ACE prompt evals ASAP on more samples
    - Looking for the same jump in ACE scores as seen in Delali's findings from Kasey's changes
- Action Items:
  - [ ] Sample more data per day
  - [ ] Evaluate on sampled data

### LLM Evals Standup

- Time: 2:00PM - 2:20PM
- Participants: Team
- Key Points:
  - Peter working with synthetic fail cases
  - Calvin working with GoldenV2 for evaluations at each step of response

## Technical Notes

- Use of semaphores for rate limiting when sending IO requests in parallel
- [Post on how to use async](https://paradigm-academy.lighton.ai/en/asynchronous-api-requests-with-asyncopenai-client)

## Learnings & Insights

- A cool project could be to implement a SOTA synthetic data generation library for internal use
  - Increase sample size especially for imbalanced datasets
  - Resolve problem with PII where we store synthetic data instead with same statistical characteristics as real data

## Challenges & Solutions

## Tomorrow's Plan

- Increase sample size
