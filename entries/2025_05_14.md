# Wednesday - May 14th

## Daily Overview
- Start Time: 8:53AM
- End Time: 7:21PM

## Today's Priorities
1. Learn repo and workflow and data from Calvin
2. Learn data from Fizza

## Tasks & Progress
### Completed
- PP sessions
  - Calvin - 05.14
    - Uses UV for working in support-ml-science
    - Metadata Portal for datasets
      - shopify-dw and layers for different stages
    - BigQuery for pulling data and saving sql query in repo
      - support.shop_buyer_assistant_chat_messages
      - Work in sdp-stg-commercial
  - Fizza - 05.14
    - Look for queries in speaker notes executable in [BigQuery console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=shopify-dw)
    - Looked at many different data sources: voice_of_customer, support_issue_taxonomy_classifications, etc
    - [Pairing notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13e4A7-pfJQFL3sOvehhS60dNvGY_LNL69IFUqovw-lU/edit?tab=t.0)
    - HCA min - Experiment to see if minimizing HCA bot will increase search engagement
      - Included in search engagement is measuring frustration and complexity
        - We don't want users to avoid HCA if frustration will increase
        - We expect to see more complex queries to be sent to HCA rather than search
      - Need human-eval to measure these metrics
      - Fizza will send me the sql code on this later -> should diagram in Figma to understand joins
    - Linked a cool [blog post](https://www.benkuhn.net/impact/)
- Used Cursor to learn support-core
  - Different agents serve different purposes (ex. ClassificationAgent classifies conversation for downstream interaction)
  - HCAAgent base class built on LanguageModelKit which makes it easier to interact with LLMs


### In Progress
- Label SBA interactions [samples](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C_e-9mWuntHttaK562nS7sP_d1yXdOTbhRj84eCIEjQ/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
  - Alot of the problems is passed onto the merchant (ex. order related info)
    - Is there a classification for merchant handoffs?
- Technical Onboarding
  - Current status: Ruby (OOP)
- PP session prep
  - Kasey - 05.16
    - Demo on HCA
  - Shannon - 05.21

## Meetings & Discussions
### Pair Programming - Calvin
- Time: 12:30PM - 2:30PM
- Participants: Calvin
- Key Points:
  - Q1 ended with setting up human evals for bot interactions
  - Q2 will focus on evalutations by LLMS
    - Want to see if human evals will be consistent to see if it is even feasable with LLMs
    - Come up with intuition to start prototyping
- Action Items:
  - [ ] Label SBA interactions [samples](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C_e-9mWuntHttaK562nS7sP_d1yXdOTbhRj84eCIEjQ/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
  - [ ] Experiment with LLMs for response evaluations with few-shot prompting
  - [ ] Learn about [LLM eval project](https://vault.shopify.io/gsd/proposals/9ETAno) for Q2
  - [ ] Play with the BigQuery console
    - Make sure you can execute SELECT 1
    - Reach out to #help-commercial-data-platform if you can’t access—ask them what GH teams or Google Groups fall under the umbrella of access
  - [ ] Read through [QAU documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sfNOpJTmoNoyYs_lIkPMgTLlii61nWy_ygC1sb-_zyU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.gdqdy9yvqkj5)
  - [ ] Read about [PII](https://vault.shopify.io/page/Personally-identifiable-information-PII~4631.md)

### Pair Programming - Fizza
- Time: 2:35PM - 5:00PM
- Participants: Fizza
- Key Points:
  - Different people engage with different parts of support data (advisor side and HCA side)
  - Need to account for different biases
    - Do we include users that started before the experiment window but ended within? What about users that started before and ended after, but still spanned the duration of the experiment?
- Action Items:
  - [ ] Follow up with Fizza on sql code
