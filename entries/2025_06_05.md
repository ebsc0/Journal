# Friday - June 5th

## Daily Overview

- Start Time: 9:40AM
- End Time: 4:49PM

## Today's Priorities

1. Get ACE evals done
2. Finish writeup for classification evals
3. Clear backlog

## Tasks & Progress

### Completed

### In Progress

- ACE
  - Use LLM to summarize reasonings for specific dates
    - 6th vs 7th
    - 7th vs 13th
  - Use LLM to compare the summaries and see if it can detect the large change in performance
  - Pull more samples per day
    - Then 50 -> 100 samples from [~2.5k samples](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dvf0ZMQgb9DH0-pSNXZ1Uc9m0x6yBpJIW-Wy7C1E3gI/edit?usp=sharing)
    - Filter on candidate_sessions where message != REDACTED and locale == en
    - Time is last 30 days
- Classification Set Analysis
  - Create 1-page writeup
- Fill out internship log
  - Write update on Summit and progress
  - Include anything pushed
- Technical Onboarding
  - Current status: Ruby (OOP)
- Think about contract extension; Make sure sequence is correct

## Meetings & Discussions

### Daily Standup

- Time: 10:00AM - 10:20AM
- Participants: Calvin
- Key Points:
  - Prompt iteration showed that clearer, simpler, shorter instructions gave higher metrics across the board
    - Link to [github](https://github.com/Shopify/support-data-ml/blob/cdlm/eval-foundations-q2-2025-shop-classif-judge/eval_foundations_q2_2025/src/shop_bot_classification/prompts.py#L202-L227)
    - A good way to do this is to split the dataset to test and train and ask the LLM to generate a prompt based on the train set
      - I think we could also test on the train set since explicit samples are not being encoded in the prompt (output)
      - A caveat is that you need to be careful on the LLM trying to overfit by passing in examples or too explicit instructions in the prompt
  - Interesting test would be to give simpler prompt to subset of annotators and see if performance increases -> Test if more instructions is not always better
  - ACE
    - Use 50 samples for now and scale later
    - Visually see where the changes occur
    - Compare the reasons for these days
      - 6th vs 7th
      - 7th vs 13th
    - Remark Kaseyâ€™s changes on 7th
- Action Items:
  - [ ] Use LLM to summarize reasonings for specific dates
  - [ ] Use LLM to compare the summaries and see if it can detect the large change in performance
