## Meetings & Discussions

### Sync

- Time: 9:30AM - 9:40AM
- Participants: Calvin
- Key Points:
  - SBA classification labeling should be done by classifying 7 inquiry types rather than pass/fail
    - Prompts labeller to think more deeply about what they are evaluating
    - More fine-grained idea of where LLM judge and human annotator disagrees
    - LLM judge will observe the inquiry type and message and determine pass/fail
  - Interesting experiment with Claude where Calvin asked LLM judge to rewrite their own prompt
    - Have to watch out for overfitting by manually inspecting the prompts
