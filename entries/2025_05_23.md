# Friday - May 23rd

## Daily Overview

- Start Time: 9:30AM
- End Time: 8:53PM

## Today's Priorities

1. Complete report with findings

## Tasks & Progress

### Completed

- Write up some simple instructions for labelling (including what each class means, tell him not to look at your work)
- Add a copy of a sheet for Delali, remove all your labels
- SBA inquiry classification prototype
  - Create report
    - Classification was evaluated at a session level since the LLM is also given context and is explicitly promted to look at history of messages
    - Unclear with classifying unspecific and specific orders
      - When are questions about a specific order and when are they generic?
- Read [Replacing Judges with Juries](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18796)

## Meetings & Discussions

### Daily Standup

- Time: 10:00AM - 10:20AM
- Participants: Calvin
- Key Points:
  - ACE
    - [Overall Eval](https://github.com/Shopify/sidekick/blob/main/src/ace/prompts/buyer/20250422/system_overall.md)
    - [System Response Eval](https://github.com/Shopify/sidekick/blob/main/src/ace/prompts/buyer/20250422/system_response_quality.md)
    - Evaluate interactions using ACE and investigate it on a time series
      - Is ACE a good metric? Noise? Variance?
- Action Items:
  - [x] Write up some simple instructions for labelling (including what each class means, tell him not to look at your work)
  - [x] Add a copy of a sheet for Delali, remove all your labels
  - [ ] Fill out internship log

### Bridge the Gap

- Time: 12:30PM - 2:00PM
- Participants: Tiffany
- Key Points:
  - Don't use AI too much since not too dependable and too slow
  - Use Guru to validate answers but Guru is wrong sometimes
  - Use copilot
  - Use slack
  - Tenured merchant → tenured advisor
  - 7 tickets in 4.5 hours (~20min per ticket but high variability)
  - Easy questions:
  - “Why am I getting billed twice?” or “Why am I getting billed even if I
  - Have another store
  - Billing cycle just got delayed
  - “How can I do this?”
  - Not a feature but happy to look for apps
  - Standby time waiting for approval when viewing a store that has not been authenticated by the current user
  - Sometimes merchant doesn't know what the problem is and advisors need to ask context gathering questions
  - Buyer chats mostly on black friday and boxing day for missing orders but nothing that advisors can do.
  - Merchant chats
  - Users don't want to engage with AI so even easy questions are sent to advisor
  - Ticket updates aren't supported but would be easy and helpful to deflect
  - Beacon refreshes, cant find ticket in zendesk → maybe due to PII
  - admin UI continuing to update is confusing to once already familiar merchants and advisors
  - Sometimes Guru support articles sometimes show out-of-date UI
  - AI search takes too long
  - Need to wait a long time
  - Advisors use search too
  - Merchants are confused with Merchant account and Partner account
  - HCA advisor escalation are only in the context of the account
  - Merchant Partner authentication issues
  - Help Center can pull info from Shopify dev doc
  - Some people can't find the right place to ask questions
  - If HCA can point to where those resources are
  - Merchants aren't aware of terminology
  - “Did you mean …”

## Challenges & Solutions

- My methodology of measuring the LLM judge on SBA classification was flawed. I first tried to classify myself and mark those classifications as pass or fail depending on if they matched. But this was not the way I tested the LLM judge. Instead of asking it to classify, I made it evaluate which should then also be my way of labelling.
  - To no surprise, this resulted in very poor performance
  - Therefore, I restarted my labelling by only marking pass or fail
    - This gave a more accurate picture on what the problem was

## Tomorrow's Plan

- Brief Calvin and team on findings
- Think of next steps
