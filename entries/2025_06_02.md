## Meetings & Discussions

### Daily Standup

- Time: 11:00AM - 11:30AM
- Participants: Calvin
- Key Points:

  - Today's focus is to explore the data
    - Examine if there is inter-rater reliability
      - We can use cohen's kappa
    - Examine which samples annotators agreed/disagreed on
  - Our goal is to evaluate the LLM judge on the new data and see if metrics increase
    - With original prompt
    - With few-shot samples where annotators agreed 3/3
    - With vibe coded prompt [framework](https://github.com/Shopify/support-data-ml/blob/cdlm/eval-foundations-q2-2025-shop-classif-judge/eval_foundations_q2_2025/docs/shop_bot_classification/overview.md)
    - LLM judge with evolving historic context

- Action Items:
  - [ ] sample size stats (count of examples by # of labellers, % with at least 1 annotator)
  - [ ] IRR (annotator-annotator and bot-annotator)
    - for bot-annotator, consider cases where both annotators agreed to simplify analysis
  - [ ] inter-annotator confusion matrix (which issue types had the most / least agreement)
  - [ ] bot/annotator confusion matrix
