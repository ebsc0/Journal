## Meetings & Discussions
### Daily Standup
- Time: 3:30PM - 3:50PM 
- Participants: Calvin De Lima
- Key Points:
  - Reviewing bots (HCA) with Kasey
  - Enrolling in Bridge-The-Gap
  - Learning about LLM evaluation
  - Calvin has some projects he has in mind for me to work on before going into LLM eval
- Action Items:
  - [ ] Continue reviewing ML best practices doc
  - [ ] Practice using UV and Claude - can work in support-ml-science repo
  - [ ] Learn about [monorail](https://vault.shopify.io/page/Monorail~1rHm.md)
  - [ ] Use Cursor to learn support-core for pairing session

### Support Data Team Sync
- Time: 2:30PM - 3:30PM
- Participants: Team
- Key Points:
  - Increase traction on search for quicker resolutions rather than defaulting to HCA
    - Search can be done in fewer shots
    - HCA is more specific but takes longer to resolve
    - Improve search quality by figuring out user intention
- MCP: Model Context Protocal
- Moving towards using [github](https://github.com/orgs/Shopify/projects/9832/views/1) to track projects
- Shipped:
  - Automated refunds (Kasey): Enable bot to approve refunds if certain criteria is met
  - Shop bot improvement (Kasey)
  - Autocomplete (Calvin, Peter): Provide autocomplete suggestions for AI search tool

## Technical Notes
- Kasey is looking for reviews on her [PR](https://github.com/Shopify/smiley-set/pull/1617)
- "Open a pull request by ⌘ (cmd) + clicking on the link that appears after the Create a pull request… output from the previous command. You can also use dev open pr. This will open a template to complete."

## Learnings & Insights
- Ruby
  - Everything is a class
  - Return can be implicit
  - 0 is truthy
  - Printing a range that is an element in an array will not print the entire range
  - Similar to Python in many ways. Just some syntactical differences

## Challenges & Solutions
- Preparing for pairing sessions
- Learn unfamiliar tech (Kafka, monorail, Ruby, BigQuery)

## Tomorrow's Plan
- Finish Ruby onboarding
- Explore support-core before pairing session
- Use Claude and UV in support-ml-science
